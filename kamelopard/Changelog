= 0.0.12

* Add function bounce() to simulate flying in bounce mode between two
AbstractViews
* Add support for timestamp / timespan in make_function_paths and
make_view_from
* Fix convert_coords to return floats, not strings
* Add multidimensional function API, and spline functions to use it
* Add code to calculate positions for simulated panoramic cameras, hereafter
known as "multicam"

= 0.0.11

* Add ability to change the current document easily
* Update documentation
* Given an abstractview, return a string suitable for queries.txt
* Add handling of various mathematical function types for calculating paths, etc.
* Add better support for KML Change elements

= 0.0.10

* Bug fix: Untangle reversed logic in slave / master mode handling

= 0.0.9

* Add master/slave mode to documents, and to objects. Now objects can be
tagged as "master_only", and will thereby show up only in KML created when the
Document's master_mode is true. This makes it easier to make tours where the
master node needs to have various screen overlays or network links, but the
slaves don't.
* Added logging feature. Use Kamelopard.set_logger() to set a callback
function that runs whenever Kamelopard wants to log something. Supports log
levels. Few log messages exist at this point.

= 0.0.8

* Move from Github to the Liquid Galaxy Google Code repository
* Add support for multiple simultaneous documents
* Add support for viewsyncrelay actions
* Add default wait at the beginning of each tour, to prevent glitches
* Fix quite a bit of CDATA handling

= 0.0.7

* Add lots of new helper functions
* Add functions to extract placemarks from existing KML
* Added functions to create an HTML tour index automatically
* Fix bug in NetworkLinks
* Handle UTF8 in source code properly
* Fix balloonVisibility error

= 0.0.6

* Support resolution argument to interpolate()
* Add several new helper functions
* Add support for gx:Track objects
* Handle coordinates with strange spaces in them, support real degrees symbol
* Fix bug with polygons
* Add functions for processing telemetry data
* Add decent ExtendedData support

= 0.0.5

* Changed constructors to accept arguments as a hash, rather than some arbitrary and hard-to-remember order
* Converted from REXML to libxml; speed improved dramatically
* Added better CDATA support to Feature description attributes
* Removed color elements from ListStyle
* Fix AnimatedUpdates and Snippets to make them more reliable
* Added support for Polygon and MultiGeometry objects
* Fixed support functions and PointList to handle Kamelopard module
* Added NetworkLink objects

= 0.0.4

* Changed all KML output to produce REXML::Element and REXML::Document objects, instead of simply strings containing XML
* Wrapped all of Kamelopard in a module, to prevent name collisions
* Changed variuos names to something meaningful, where previously they'd been deliberately made strange to avoid namespace problems
* Finished test suite, taking into account all the above changes

= 0.0.3

* Significantly expanded test suite after converting it to use rspec
* Added support for several new objects
* Removed some error checks that didn't work properly

= 0.0.2

* Add soundcue objects
* Add support for dms format lat/long
* Include geocode library by default, and remove XML because it was a pain

= 0.0.1

* Initial github push, including basic classes for most KML objects, spline code, and some helper functions
